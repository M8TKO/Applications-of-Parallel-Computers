# Asynchronous and Parallel Programming (C++)

This repository contains implementations and experiments related to **asynchronous and parallel programming** on modern computer systems.

---

## ðŸ“š Overview

The focus is on designing efficient and scalable software that utilizes parallel hardware and asynchronous execution models. The repository includes examples of both shared-memory and distributed computing, as well as code targeting heterogeneous platforms.

---

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered

- **Vectorization**
- **Multithreaded Programming**
- **Distributed Systems Programming**
- **Heterogeneous System Programming** (GPUs, accelerators)

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- C++17 / C++20
- Standard threading (`<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<atomic>`, `<shared_mutex>`)
- Custom data structures with synchronization
- Parallel algorithms and benchmarking utilities

---

## ðŸ§ª Compilation

Use a C++17 or newer compiler. For multithreaded programs:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -pthread -o program_name source_file.cpp
```

> Ensure all required header files are in the same directory.

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

Each executable runs a self-contained test or demonstration. Outputs are written to `.txt` files or printed to the console for inspection.

---

## âœ… Status

All programs function correctly and demonstrate the intended concepts in parallel and asynchronous programming.
